    question: 'Should one invest in small cities?',
    answer: 'In small cities, the appreciation is usually less but so is the initial investment compared to the metros. However, with major infrastructure developments, cities like Indore, Coimbatore, Bhubaneshwar and a few others are witnessing growth in prices as well as returns. Always choose a city that has good economic drivers such as IT, ITeS or manufacturing hubs. This ensures continued user interest for re-sale when you want to exit an investment or for rental returns while you hold the property till it is well leveraged and gives good returns.'
